Python scripts for encryption and decryption ciphers. The idea is to group as many techniques and algorithms as possible for encryption and decryption of texts.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Running

To run, you just need to call this script from a terminal or prompt.

After execution, the options will be presented in a menu format. From this menu you can decid**e if you want to encode or decode a text and then you can choose a form of encryption from the available ones.

## Future Releases

- Addition of other encryption algorithms such as Transposition Cipher and Vigen√®re Cipher.
- Execution of the algorithms without menu selection.
- Texts from files.
- Allow save results to a file.
